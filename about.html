      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Gerry Gorgonia, an enthusiastic IT student at Rizal Technological University with a passion for 
        technology and a zest for life. As I navigate the exciting world of information technology, 
        I find joy in the perfect balance between the digital and the physical. Currently pursuing my degree in IT, 
        I am dedicated to acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in the dynamic and ever-evolving tech landscape. 
        Rizal Technological University has been my playground for learning, where I'm constantly exploring new horizons and pushing my intellectual boundaries. 
        Beyond the digital realm, I have a penchant for adventure and sports. Skateboarding and basketball 
        are not just activities for meâ€”they are avenues for self-expression and a way to stay physically active. T
        he rush of the wind while skateboarding and the camaraderie on the basketball court provide me with a well-rounded perspective, which I bring into my academic and professional endeavors.
